# Pilot Migration Program

Documentation and framework for conducting pilot migrations to validate the CICD Template System with real projects.

## 📋 Program Overview

### Purpose

The Pilot Migration Program validates the CICD Template System by migrating real projects and measuring the impact on:

- Development productivity
- CI/CD pipeline performance
- Code quality and consistency
- Team satisfaction and adoption

### Target Participants

- **2-3 active projects** (Python and/or C++)
- **Teams willing to provide feedback**
- **Projects with existing CI/CD setup** (for comparison)
- **Medium complexity** (not too simple, not enterprise-scale)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Project setup time** | < 2 minutes | Automated measurement |
| **CI/CD pipeline speed** | 2-10x faster | GitHub Actions timing |
| **Code quality consistency** | 100% standardized | Automated linting/formatting |
| **Build success rate** | > 95% | CI/CD pass/fail tracking |
| **Developer satisfaction** | > 4/5 rating | Team survey |

### Process Metrics

- ✅ Migration completed without blockers
- ✅ Team trained on new workflows
- ✅ Documentation updated with lessons learned
- ✅ Performance improvements measured and documented
- ✅ Issues identified and resolved

## 📅 Migration Timeline

### Week 1: Preparation
- **Day 1**: Project selection and team onboarding
- **Day 2**: Baseline measurement of current setup
- **Day 3**: Migration planning and backup procedures

## 🔧 Migration Process

### Phase 1: Project Selection

**Criteria:**
- Active development (recent commits)
- Existing CI/CD pipeline
- Team willing to participate
- Not mission-critical (safe for experimentation)
- Representative of typical projects

**Selection Checklist:**
- [ ] Project has existing CI/CD setup
- [ ] Team is available for 2-week program
- [ ] Project has moderate complexity
- [ ] Existing performance metrics available
- [ ] Team agrees to provide feedback

### Phase 2: Baseline Measurement

**Current State Assessment:**
1. **Project Setup Time**: Time to create similar project from scratch
2. **CI/CD Performance**: Current pipeline duration and success rate
3. **Code Quality**: Existing linting/formatting setup
4. **Developer Workflow**: Manual steps and pain points
5. **Tool Dependencies**: Current tools and configurations

**Measurement Tools:**
```bash
# Measure current performance
./scripts/measure-performance.sh /path/to/current/project -f table

# Create baseline report
./scripts/measure-performance.sh /path/to/current/project -o baseline.json
```

### Phase 3: Migration Execution

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Backup Current Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create backup branch
   git checkout -b backup/pre-migration
   git push origin backup/pre-migration

   # Backup configurations
   cp -r .github/workflows .github/workflows.backup
   cp pyproject.toml pyproject.toml.backup
   cp .pre-commit-config.yaml .pre-commit-config.yaml.backup
   ```

2. **Apply Template Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Sync configurations
   bash ../scripts/sync-templates.sh python .

   # Or create new project from template and migrate code
   ```

3. **Update CI/CD Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Replace workflows with reusable templates
   # Update .github/workflows/ci.yaml
   ```

4. **Test Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Install new dependencies
   pip install -e .[dev]

   # Run pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit run --all-files

   # Test build/test locally
   pytest  # Python
   # or
   cmake --build build && ctest  # C++
   ```

5. **Commit and Test CI/CD**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Migrate to CICD template system"
   git push origin main

   # Monitor CI/CD execution
   ```

### Phase 4: Validation and Measurement

**Post-Migration Measurement:**
```bash
# Measure new performance
./scripts/measure-performance.sh /path/to/migrated/project \
  -o post-migration.json \
  -c baseline.json
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline succeeds
- [ ] Code formatting consistent
- [ ] No regressions in functionality
- [ ] Performance improvements measured
- [ ] Team can complete normal workflow

### Phase 5: Feedback Collection

**Team Survey Questions:**
1. How satisfied are you with the new setup? (1-5)
2. What improvements did you notice?
3. What issues did you encounter?
4. How was the migration experience?
5. Would you recommend this to other teams?

**Technical Feedback:**
- Performance improvements observed
- Tools and features used most
- Missing features or configurations
- Integration issues with existing workflows
